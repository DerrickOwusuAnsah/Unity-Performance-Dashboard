Empowering Finance with Insights | Unity Capital Cooperative Dashboard ðŸ’¹ðŸ“Š

I developed a financial performance dashboard for Unity Capital Cooperative to demonstrate how data can drive transparency, accountability, and strategic decision-making in the financial sector. The objective was to showcase growth trends, efficiency, and resilience in cooperative finance.

The dashboard highlights strong profitability, with net surplus, operating profit, and cost-to-income ratio displayed in a simple yet powerful layout. Balance sheet data shows steady growth in assets and equity, while liabilities are managed responsibly. The equity and assets composition visuals reveal how member contributions and reserves form the backbone of financial stability, complemented by a diverse mix of liquid funds, investments, and other assets.

Efficiency and risk ratios such as ROA, ROE, liquidity, and savings-to-loans provide a clear picture of financial health. These metrics reveal a resilient cooperative that is managing resources effectively while maintaining the confidence of its members. Operating expenses are broken down into personnel, administration, and other categories, offering management clear visibility on cost concentration risks and areas for efficiency improvement.

What makes this dashboard stand out is not just the numbers but the story it tells. The visuals highlight profitability drivers, balance sheet strength, and resilience indicators in a way that empowers both executives and members to see the bigger picture. It transforms financial data into a narrative of accountability, stability, and sustainable growth for the cooperative sector.

This project underscores how financial dashboards can be a powerful tool for storytelling, enabling decision-makers to translate complex data into actionable insights that strengthen governance and inspire confidence.
