# Unity Financial Performance Dashboard  

A sample **Power BI dashboard** built with free data to showcase financial performance reporting, business intelligence, and data analytics using Power BI.  

---

## 📖 Overview  
This project demonstrates how development-sector organisations can transform financial data into actionable insights. The dashboard highlights **profitability, efficiency, and risk indicators** through interactive visuals, with a focus on transparency and ease of interpretation.  

---

## 🎯 What It Shows  
- **Profitability**: Net Surplus, Operating Profit, Gross Profit  
- **Efficiency**: Cost-to-Income Ratio, Operating Expense breakdown  
- **Balance Sheet Strength**: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, and composition  
- **Risk & Liquidity**: Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Liquidity Ratio, and Savings-to-Loans  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated  
- **Power BI** for dashboard design and interactive reporting  
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX** measures for profitability, efficiency, and risk ratios  
- **Data Modelling** (fact and dimension tables for financial reporting)  
- **Visual Analytics** to tell a clear story for management decision-making  

---

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures  
```DAX
Gross Profit = [Revenue] - [Cost of Funds]  
Operating Profit = [Gross Profit] - [Operating Expenses]  
Net Surplus = [Operating Profit]  
Cost to Income Ratio = DIVIDE([Operating Expenses],[Revenue])  
ROA = DIVIDE([Net Surplus],[Assets])  
ROE = DIVIDE([Net Surplus],[Equity])  

---
## 📊 Example Insights
Profitability is solid: Net Surplus ₵155.7K; C/I Ratio 44.4%
Assets >₵3M with stable equity base
ROA (4%) and ROE (16%) reflect resilience
Personnel & Administration >70% of Opex → efficiency opportunity

## 🔑 Why This Matters for Employers
This project shows how I:
- Translate complex financial data into insightful dashboards
- Apply MERL principles to financial performance tracking
- Use digital tools (Power BI, Power Query, SQL, Excel automation) to drive evidence-based decisions
- Deliver outputs that are replicable across NGOs, SMEs, and development projects
